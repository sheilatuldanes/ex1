                    In this exercise, I wanted to keep my design very simple and minimalistic. With my design, it makes the user question and want to explore what my page is about. I added hovering effects on the images to hopefully give a hint to the user that they have to click on it. When the user clicks on the image, information appears concerning the object in the photo. I decided to have my design this way because I think that the simpler it is, the more comfortable a user will be navigating through the website. There is not too much text on the page, which makes it less overwhelming. In addition, I gave each picture its own color to show that their are separate elements.

                    In this exercise, I made sure the website was engaging visually through the use of a grid-like structure. Having it organized in a simple way helps the user to figure out how to navigate the website more easily. I also included brighter colors and small icons to give a fun aspect to the overall design. The interaction I used was by hiding the recorded activities. But with the user seeing the hover effect on the big words, their next instinct (hopefully) is to click on it ultimately revealing the different activities that fall under the category. In addition, double clicking on the words hides the activities in the category. By keeping the interactivity and design simple, users will be able to use the website more comfortably.

                    With <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects/9-Why_Priority_Clarity_Purpose">Bill Derouchey's article/slideshow</a>, I had a better understanding of everday interfaces that utilizes some type of form. One form that I often use is the UC Davis Schedule Builder. As a student, I find it very useful. It is much easier to use than how students previously registered (which was through SisWeb). The website is really easy to navigate through because the buttons that you really need is seen on the top of the page. When you click on a button, say "Add/Search Courses", a form shows up with specific inputs that narrows the options. However, one criticism that I have is that the website can be a bit busy. There is a lot of text surrounding the course schedule.

                <p>As far as interface goes, I think one that is very effective is the Buzzfeed App on the iPhone 6. I use it very often to find out any news or to just look at fun articles. I think its simple design, with its white background and its organized, grid structure, is what is most appealing. Itâ€™s not too busy with all the content it has. All of the links, content, and buttons are good sizes for the platform it is in. I am able to click on them without having the problem of mistakenly clicking on something else. I also think that, overall, the app is really easy to use. A lot of what it contains is very self-explanatory. It goes straight to the list of articles when you enter the app, so you can scroll and click on whatever interests you. The menu bar is really helpful in navigating what you are trying to look for (and it also has a really pretty gradient on it).
